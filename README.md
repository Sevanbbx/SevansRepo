To start enjoying all the features of my program, just download all the files and install the Fairy.deb package. 
Connect your phone to PC via USB, allow acces to camera, press the button below and see magic happening in your phone :)

I've been working on this so hard and would be glad to learn what you think about this application.
Send what you think about this on best@appliaction.ever and we will have a chat.

Enjoy! :)
